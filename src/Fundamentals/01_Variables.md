# Variables, Data Types and Ranges in Java

## What are variables?
A variable is a container which stores a value in a Java program. Each variable has a type associated with it, which is defined at its declaration.
- Variable name: A label for a memory location.
- Value: Something that would be stored in a variable.
- Storage: A place where data can be stored.
- Declaration: Announcing a variable (usually) at the beginning of a program.
- Naming convention: A set of rules about the names of variables.
- Assignment: Assigning a value to a variable.

### Naming Conventions:
- For naming a variable, we can use uppercase and lowercase letters, digits from `0` to `9` and underscore `_`.
- First character must be an underscore or a letter.
- Java is a strongly typed language. So every variable needs to be declared before using it.
- Examples:
  - <table>
        <thead>
            <th>Valid Variable Name</th>
            <th>Invalid Variable Name</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>int students2</td>
                <td>int 2students</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
  </table>
  
## Data types in Java:
Data types are used to identify the type of data and associate operations that can be done on the data values. Data types define the value that a variable can take.
Data types specify crucial information about:
- The size of the memory location.
- The maximum and the minimum value that can be stored in the memory location.
- Different types of operations that can be done on the memory location.
